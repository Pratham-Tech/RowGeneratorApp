This android app is written in kotlin.
This app shows a demonstration of RecyclerView Containers .
on launching, it will ask for how many rows to generate then on clicking generate button it will generate the respective rows.
Moreover, i have implemented my first ever interface interaction with user in this app .
Suppose you click on a row, it will display the information of that row i.e row number.
Recycler View is a very useful and efficient container in terms of memory saving and efficiency.
Thank You
